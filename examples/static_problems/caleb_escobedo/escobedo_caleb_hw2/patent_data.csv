A time-delayed neural network having an improved architecture is trained at the word level with an improved method, which, along with preprocessing improvements, results in a recognizer with greater recognition accuracy. Preprocessing is performed on the input data and, for example, may include resampling the data with sample points based on the second derivative to focus the recognizer on areas of the input data where the slope change per time is greatest. The input data is segmented, featurized and fed to the time-delayed neural network which outputs a matrix of character scores per segment. The neural network architecture outputs a separate score for the start and the continuation of a character. A dynamic time warp (DTW) is run against dictionary words to find the most probable path through the output matrix for that word, and each word is assigned a score based on the least costly path that can be traversed through the output matrix. The word (or words) with the overall lowest score (or scores) are returned.

Information provided to the operator through a user-friendly interface is used to characterize the type of interference and its degree of severity. Once characterized, the information is used by the operator to take corrective actions including the activation of alternative communication plans or, in some instances, mitigation of the interference. Since output from the system of this invention lends itself well to expert system and neural network environments, such systems could be employed to further aid the operator. The unique interference signal measurements provided by the system makes it useful in applications well beyond those for which it was originally intended.

"An automated speech recognition system converts a speech signal into a compact, coded representation that correlates to a speech phoneme set. A number of different neural network pattern matching schemes may be used to perform the necessary speech coding. An integrated user interface guides a user unfamiliar with the details of speech recognition or neural networks to quickly develop and test a neural network for phoneme recognition. To train the neural network, digitized voice data containing known phonemes that the user wants the neural network to ultimately recognize are processed by the integrated user interface. The digitized speech is segmented into phonemes with each segment being labelled with a corresponding phoneme code. Based on a user selected transformation method and transformation parameters, each segment is transformed into a series of multiple dimension vectors representative of the speech characteristics of that segment. These vectors are iteratively presented to a neural network to train/adapt that neural network to consistently distinguish and recognize these vectors and assign an appropriate phoneme code to each vector. Simultaneous display of the digitized speech, segments, vector sets, and a representation of the trained neural network assist the user in visually confirming the acceptability of the phoneme training set.

A number of different neural network pattern matching schemes may be used to perform the necessary speech coding. An integrated user interface guides a user unfamiliar with the details of speech recognition or neural networks to quickly develop and test a neural network for phoneme recognition.

Detecting harmful or illegal intrusions into a computer network or into restricted portions of a computer network uses a process of synthesizing anomalous data to be used in training a neural network-based model for use in a computer network intrusion detection system. Anomalous data for artificially creating a set of features reflecting anomalous behavior for a particular activity is performed. This is done in conjunction with the creation of normal-behavior feature values. A distribution of users of normal feature values and an expected distribution of users of anomalous feature values are then defined in the form of histograms. The anomalous-feature histogram is then sampled to produce anomalous-behavior feature values. These values are then used to train a model having a neural network training algorithm where the model is used in the computer network intrusion detection system. The model is trained such that it can efficiently recognize anomalous behavior by users in a dynamic computing environment where user behavior can change frequently.,2004-07-27,6769066,Method and apparatus for training a neural network model for use in computer network intrusion detection

"The present invention features the use of the fundamental concept of color perception and multi-level resolution to perform scene segmentation and object/feature extraction in the context of self-determining and self-calibration modes. The technique uses only a single image, instead of multiple images as the input to generate segmented images. Moreover, a flexible and arbitrary scheme is incorporated, rather than a fixed scheme of segmentation analysis. The process allows users to perform digital analysis using any appropriate means for object extraction after an image is segmented. First, an image is retrieved. The image is then transformed into at least two distinct bands. Each transformed image is then projected into a color domain or a multi-level resolution setting. A segmented image is then created from all of the transformed images. The segmented image is analyzed to identify objects. Object identification is achieved by matching a segmented region against an image library. A featureless library contains full shape, partial shape and real-world images in a dual library system. The depth contours and height-above-ground structural components constitute a dual library.

Accordingly, when the relation between the neural network constructed and trained is memorized in matrix and the rank value is obtained from this matrix, if the number of the neurons in use is larger than the rank value, as it means that redundant neurons exist which correspond to dependent variables, such redundant neurons can be eliminated. In many cases, due to errors in calculation, the diagonal elements of the matrix are not reduced to 0 and consequently the rank value can not be determined. By neglecting the diagonal elements that are smaller than the specific value e, however, the rank value can be estimated within the range of the error.",1997-01-21,5596681,Method of determining an optimal number of neurons contained in hidden layers of a neural network

"Fully automated methods and systems for processing complex data sets to identify abnormalities are described. In one embodiment, the system includes wavelet processing, recursive processing to determine prominent features, and then utilizing feed forward neural networks (FFNNs) to classify feature vectors generated in the wavelet and recursive processing. With respect to wavelet processing, multiresolution (five-level) and multidirection (two-dimensional) wavelet analysis with quadratic spline wavelets is performed to transform each image. The wavelets are a first-order derivative of a smoothing function and enhance the edges of image objects. Because two-dimensional wavelet transforms quantize an image in terms of space and spatial frequency and can be ordered linearly, the data is processed recursively to determine prominent features. A neural network approach derived from sequential recursive auto-associative memory is then used to parse the wavelet coefficients and hierarchy data. Since the wavelet coefficients are continuous, linear output instead of sigmoidal output is used. This variation is therefore referred to as linear output sequential recursive auto-associative memory, or LOSRAAM. The objective of training the LOSRAAM network is to have the output exactly match the input. Context units arising from serial evaluation of the wavelet coefficient triplets may be collected as vectors. These vectors are subjected to cluster analysis. This analysis yields a number of identifiable and discrete states. From these states, feature vectors are created. Each element in the feature vector represents the number of times the corresponding state from the above cluster analysis is found. Then, feed forward neural networks (FFNNs) are trained to classify feature vectors.",2001-09-04,6285992,Neural network based methods and systems for analyzing complex data

In the second technique, the SOM is trained by applying a weight correction to each node based on the frequencies of that node and its neighbors. If any of the adjacent nodes have a frequency greater than the frequency of the present node, then the weight vector of the present node is adjusted towards the highest-frequency neighboring node.

Because a fixed set of severity indices is used, the size and architecture of the neural network is problem independent, thus permitting its use with large scale power systems. Further, the amount of required time domain simulation for the selection of the potentially harmful unstable contingencies is reduced by screening out benign, stable appearing contingencies. The network is trained off-line using training cases that concentrate around the security boundary to reduce the number of cases required to train the neural network.",1997-04-29,5625751,Neural network for contingency ranking dynamic security indices for use under fault conditions in a power distribution system

""" Each processing element has a number of weights for each input connection. These weights are coefficients of a polynomial equation. The use of quadratic nodes permits discrimination between body pixel and edge pixels, in which an intermediate value is present, using a grey scale image. In the training method of the present invention, the middle layer is initially one leaf node which is connected to each output node. The contribution of each leaf node to the total output error is determined and the weights of the inputs to the leaf nodes are adjusted to minimize the error.

From the set of trial branch nodes, the best performing node is selected and is substituted for the previously-selected leaf node. Two new leaf nodes are then created from the newly-substituted best-performing-branch node.

"A new neural model for direct classification, DC, is introduced for acoustic/pictorial data compression. It is based on the Adaptive Resonance Theorem and Kohonen Self Organizing Feature Map neural models. In the adaptive training of the DC model, an input data file is vectorized into a domain of same size vector subunits. The result of the training (step 10 to 34) is to cluster the input vector domain into classes of similar subunits, and develop a center of mass called a centroid for each class to be stored in a codebook (CB) table. In the compression process, which is parallel to the training (step 33), for each input subunit, we obtain the index of the closest centroid in the CB. All indices and the CB will form the compressed file, CF. In the decompression phase (steps 42 to 52), for each index in the CF, a lookup process is performed into the CB to obtain the centroid representative of the original subunit. The obtained centroid is placed in the decompressed file. The compression is realized because the size of the input subunit ((8 or 24)*n2 bits) is an order of magnitude larger than its encoding index log2 [size of CB] bits. In order to achieve a better compression ratio, LZW is performed on CF (step 38) before storing (or transmitting) it.",2003-08-19,6608924,Neural network model for compressing/decompressing image/acoustic data files

"An adaptive neural system (ANS) disclosed herein comprises a processor and an adaptor. The processor includes mainly a neural network whose adjustable weights are divided into nonadaptively and adaptively adjustable weights. The nonadaptively adjustable weights are determined through minimizing or reducing a nonadaptive training criterion in an off-line nonadaptive training. Being constructed with a priori training data, the nonadaptive training criterion is a function of the nonadaptively adjustable weights and the diversity variables associated with typical values of the environmental parameter. During an operation of the adaptive neural system, only the adaptively adjustable weights are adjusted on-line to adapt to the unknown environmental parameter. This adaptive training is achieved by minimizing or reducing an adaptive training criterion. The nonadaptive training allows the ANS to make full advantage of a priori information about the ANS's operating environment and helps the ANS focus on learning about and adapting to the unknown environmental parameter during the adaptive training. In many applications, the adaptively adjustable weights can be selected, without adversely affecting the ANS's performance, such that they appear quadratically in the adaptive training criterion.

"An automated speech recognition system converts a speech signal into a compact, coded representation that correlates to a speech phoneme set. A number of different neural network pattern matching schemes may be used to perform the necessary speech coding. An integrated user interface guides a user unfamiliar with the details of speech recognition or neural networks to quickly develop and test a neural network for phoneme recognition. To train the neural network, digitized voice data containing known phonemes that the user wants the neural network to ultimately recognize are processed by the integrated user interface. The digitized speech is segmented into phonemes with each segment being labelled with a corresponding phoneme code.

"An automated speech recognition system converts a speech signal into a compact, coded representation that correlates to a speech phoneme set. A number of different neural network pattern matching schemes may be used to perform the necessary speech coding. An integrated user interface guides a user unfamiliar with the details of speech recognition or neural networks to quickly develop and test a neural network for phoneme recognition. To train the neural network, digitized voice data containing known phonemes that the user wants the neural network to ultimately recognize are processed by the integrated user interface. The digitized speech is segmented into phonemes with each segment being labelled with a corresponding phoneme code. Based on a user selected transformation method and transformation parameters, each segment is transformed into a series of multiple dimension vectors representative of the speech characteristics of that segment. These vectors are iteratively presented to a neural network to train/adapt that neural network to consistently distinguish and recognize these vectors and assign an appropriate phoneme code to each vector. Simultaneous display of the digitized speech, segments, vector sets, and a representation of the trained neural network assist the user in visually confirming the acceptability of the phoneme training set. A user may also selectively audibly confirm the acceptability of the digitization scheme, the segments, and the transform vectors so that satisfactory training data are presented to the neural network. If the user finds a particular step or parameter produces an unacceptable result, the user may modify one or more of the parameters and verify whether the modification effected an improvement in performance. The trained neural network is also automatically tested by presenting a test speech signal to the integrated user interface and observing both audibly and visually automatic segmentation of the speech, transformation into multidimensional vectors, and the resulting neural network assigned phoneme codes. A method of decoding such phoneme codes using the neural network is also disclosed.",1999-01-26,5864803,Signal processing and training by a neural network for phoneme recognition

"A method and apparatus are disclosed for implementing a neural network having a sleep mode during which capacitively stored synaptic connectivity weights are refreshed. Each neuron outputs an analog activity level, represented in a preferred embodiment by the frequency of digital pulses. Feed-forward synaptic connection circuits couple the activity level outputs of first level neurons to inputs of second level neurons, and feed-back synaptic connection circuits couple outputs of second level neurons to inputs of first level neurons, the coupling being weighted according to connectivity weights stored on respective storage capacitors in each synaptic connection circuit. The network learns according to a learning algorithm under which the connections in both directions between a particular first level neuron and a particular second level neuron are strengthened to the extent of concurrence of high activity levels in both the first and second level neurons, and weakened to the extent of concurrence of a high activity level in the second level neuron and a low activity level in the first level neuron. The network is put to sleep by disconnecting all environmental inputs and providing a non-specific low activity level signal to each of the first level neurons. This causes the network to randomly traverse its state space with low intensity resonant firings, each state being visited with a probability responsive to the initial connectivity weights of the connections which abut the second level neuron representing such state. Refresh is accomplished since the learning algorithm remains active during sleep.

"In Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, rewards typically come seconds after reward-triggering actions, creating an explanatory conundrum known as the distal reward problem or the credit assignment problem. How does the brain know what firing patterns of what neurons are responsible for the reward if (1) the firing patterns are no longer there when the reward arrives and (2) most neurons and synapses are active during the waiting period to the reward? A model network and computer simulation of cortical spiking neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) modulated by dopamine (DA) is disclosed to answer this question. STDP is triggered by nearly-coincident firing patterns of a presynaptic neuron and a postsynaptic neuron on a millisecond time scale, with slow kinetics of subsequent synaptic plasticity being sensitive to changes in the extracellular dopamine DA concentration during the critical period of a few seconds after the nearly-coincident firing patterns. Random neuronal firings during the waiting period leading to the reward do not affect STDP, and hence make the neural network insensitive to this ongoing random firing activity.

"An apparatus and method for monitoring a process involve development and application of a statistically qualified neuro-analytic (SQNA) model to accurately and reliably identify process change. The development of the SQNA model is accomplished in two stages: deterministic model adaption and stochastic model modification of the deterministic model adaptation. Deterministic model adaption involves formulating an analytic model of the process representing known process characteristics, augmenting the analytic model with a neural network that captures unknown process characteristics, and training the resulting neuro-analytic model by adjusting the neural network weights according to a unique scaled equation error minimization technique. Stochastic model modification involves qualifying any remaining uncertainty in the trained neuro-analytic model by formulating a likelihood function, given an error propagation equation, for computing the probability that the neuro-analytic model generates measured process output. Preferably, the developed SQNA model is validated using known sequential probability ratio tests and applied to the process as an on-line monitoring system.

"A method for human face detection that detects faces independently of their particular poses and simultaneously estimates those poses. Our method exhibits an immunity to variations in skin color, eyeglasses, facial hair, lighting, scale and facial expressions, and others. In operation, we train a convolutional neural network to map face images to points on a face manifold, and non-face images to points far away from that manifold, wherein that manifold is parameterized by facial pose. Conceptually, we view a pose parameter as a latent variable, which may be inferred through an energy-minimization process. To train systems based upon our inventive method, we derive a new type of discriminative loss function that is tailored to such detection tasks. Our method enables a multi-view detector that can detect faces in a variety of poses, for example, looking left or right (yaw axis), up or down (pitch axis), or tilting left or right (roll axis). Systems employing our method are highly-reliable, run at near real time (5 frames per second on conventional hardware), and is robust against variations in yaw (±90°), roll(±45°), and pitch(±60°).",2007-06-26,7236615,Synergistic face detection and pose estimation with energy-based models
Detecting harmful or illegal intrusions into a computer network or into restricted portions of a computer network uses a process of synthesizing anomalous data to be used in training a neural network-based model for use in a computer network intrusion detection system. Anomalous data for artificially creating a set of features reflecting anomalous behavior for a particular activity is performed. This is done in conjunction with the creation of normal-behavior feature values. A distribution of users of normal feature values and an expected distribution of users of anomalous feature values are then defined in the form of histograms. The anomalous-feature histogram is then sampled to produce anomalous-behavior feature values. These values are then used to train a model having a neural network training algorithm where the model is used in the computer network intrusion detection system. The model is trained such that it can efficiently recognize anomalous behavior by users in a dynamic computing environment where user behavior can change frequently.,2013-09-03,8527776,Synthesis of anomalous data to create artificial feature sets and use of same in computer network intrusion detection systems

"The system and method for provisioning resources in a network provides real time, parallel evaluation of the best path within the network using neural network principles. Elements of the network having a plurality of paths are assigned relative values according to a network user's requirements. Attributes may include factors such as reliability, cost, speed, distance, expandability, etc., and may be static or dynamic. Selection of a best path from the plurality of paths comprises application of fuzzy logic, using a threshold function to identify a best relative path value by providing an input to the function which is a combination of the attribute values of the elements within each path. The input to the function is the sum of weighted attribute values, where each attribute value is multiplied by a weight which is a relative value determined in accordance with the network user's priorities; the higher the priority, the greater the weight applied to that attribute. Computation of the threshold function is performed for each path and the resulting values are compared to a pre-determined threshold value to determine if the threshold has been crossed. If a single optimal path has not been identified during this step, the weights of the various attributes are adjusted in order of their priority; upward if no paths have crossed the threshold and downward if multiple paths have crossed the threshold. The process is continued with increasingly smaller incremental changes in the weights until a single combination of elements provides a path value which crosses the threshold, indicating the best path for meeting the network user's criteria.
