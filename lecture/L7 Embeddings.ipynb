    "So far, we have almost exclusively used images. We have classified them and we have generated them. How about text? At the end, a text is a time-series of ASCII characters, and we could surely train pattern detectors and generators on them. Grammar is a lot less forgiving then graphics, however, and a slightly different shade of gray that might go unobserved in an image, might make a text unreafable (unreadable). In some applications such as translation, text understanding or generation it might therefore make sense to rely on words, not characters, as the smallest digestible unit. A naive approach would be to create a dictionary in which words are represented by integer values. These in turn can be represented by one-hot encoding:\n",

    "- We have shown \"embeddings\" in the context of words as lanugage usually has a lot of them and a more direct encoding is infeasible. Embeddings do work in any of these situations in which a dimensionality reduction of otherwise discrete classes is desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have also seen that embeddings can be learned to encode desired properties, such as similarity between individual elements. This can be learned by using Keras' \"merge\" layers, and in particular the dot product. Merge layers are a powerful method to create interesting new systems. For example, a \"concatenate\" layer can be used to merge networks with different kinds of input. For example, a house's price might be predicted from statistical data as well as images, see for example https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/02/04/keras-multiple-inputs-and-mixed-data/.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are very few problems in NLP that can be solved based on a single word or a word tensor of a fixed length. Rather, we will require looking at the history of words to understand meaning, motivating the use of recurrent neural networks."
